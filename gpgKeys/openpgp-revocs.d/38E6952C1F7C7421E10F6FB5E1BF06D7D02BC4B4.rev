This is a revocation certificate for the OpenPGP key:

pub   rsa3072 2020-07-09 [SC] [expires: 2022-07-09]
      38E6952C1F7C7421E10F6FB5E1BF06D7D02BC4B4
uid          test1 <test1@test.cz>

A revocation certificate is a kind of "kill switch" to publicly
declare that a key shall not anymore be used.  It is not possible
to retract such a revocation certificate once it has been published.

Use it to revoke this key in case of a compromise or loss of
the secret key.  However, if the secret key is still accessible,
it is better to generate a new revocation certificate and give
a reason for the revocation.  For details see the description of
of the gpg command "--generate-revocation" in the GnuPG manual.

To avoid an accidental use of this file, a colon has been inserted
before the 5 dashes below.  Remove this colon with a text editor
before importing and publishing this revocation certificate.
